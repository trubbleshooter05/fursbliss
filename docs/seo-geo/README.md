# SEO + GEO System

This folder defines the working system for:

- Technical SEO hygiene (crawlability, indexability, canonical consistency, schema quality)
- GEO/AIO publishing (content shaped for both search engines and LLM retrieval)

## Files

- `technical-seo-audit-checklist.md`: repeatable audit checklist with P0/P1/P2 prioritization.
- `immersive-blog-prompt.md`: reusable prompt and writing template for high-intent, citation-ready posts.

## Weekly operating rhythm

1. Run technical checklist and log any regression.
2. Publish at least one high-intent immersive article from prompt template.
3. Refresh 2-3 older posts with new data points and `updatedAt`.
4. Submit top URLs to Search Console when materially updated.
